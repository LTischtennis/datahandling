# Recap: Data Preparation

```{r pipeline, echo=FALSE, out.width = "85%", fig.align='center',  purl=FALSE}
include_graphics("../img/data_science_pipeline.png")
```



## The dataset is imported, now what?

- In practice: still a long way to go.
- Parsable, but messy data: Inconsistencies, data types, missing observations, wide format.
- *Goal* of data preparation: Dataset is ready for analysis.
- *Key conditions*:
  1. Data values are consistent/clean within each variable.
  2. Variables are of proper data types.
  3. Dataset is in 'tidy' (in long format)!
  

## Some vocabulary

Following @wickham_2014:

- *Dataset*: Collection of *values* (numbers and strings).
- Every value belongs to a *variable* and an *observation*
- *Variable*: Contains all values that measure the same underlying attribute across units.
- *Observation*: Cointains all values measured on the same unit (e.g., a person).


## Tidy data

# Data Analysis with R

## Merging (Joining) datasets

- Combine data of two datasets in one dataset.
    - Why?
- Needed: Unique identifiers for observations ('keys').

## Merging (joining) datasets: example

```{r message=FALSE}
# load packages
library(tidyverse)

# initiate data frame on persons personal spending
df_c <- data.frame(id = c(1:3,1:3),
                   money_spent= c(1000, 2000, 6000, 1500, 3000, 5500),
                   currency = c("CHF", "CHF", "USD", "EUR", "CHF", "USD"),
                   year=c(2017,2017,2017,2018,2018,2018))
df_c

```


## Merging (joining) datasets: example

```{r message=FALSE}
# initiate data frame on persons' characteristics
df_p <- data.frame(id = 1:4,
                   first_name = c("Anna", "Betty", "Claire", "Diane"),
                   profession = c("Economist", "Data Scientist", "Data Scientist", "Economist"))
df_p
```

# Data Summaries: Selecting, Filtering, and Mutating

## Data summaries

- First step of analysis.
- Get overview over dataset.
- Show key aspects of data.
  - Inform your own statistical analysis.
  - Inform audience (helps understand advanced analytics parts)

## Data summaries: first steps

- *Select* subset of variables (e.g., for comparisons).
- *Filter* the dataset (some observations not needed in _this_ analysis).
- *Mutate* the dataset: additional values needed

## Select, filter, mutate in R (tidyverse)

- `select()`
- `filter()`
- `mutate()`


# Data Summaries: Aggregate Statistics

## Descriptive/aggregate statistics

- Overview of key characteristics of main variables used in analysis.
- Key characteristics:
  - mean
  - standard deviation
  - No. of observations
  - etc.

## Aggregate statistics in R

1. Function to compute statistic (`mean()`).
2. Function to *apply* the statistics function to one or several colums in a tidy dataset.
  - All values.
  - By group (observation categories, e.g. by gender)

## Aggregate statistics in R

- `summarise()` (in `tidyverse`)
- `group_by()` (in `tidyverse`)
- `sapply()`, `apply()`, `lapply()`, etc. (in `base`)


# Unterstanding Statistics and Probability with Code

## Random numbers and computation
<center>
*Can computers generate random numbers?!*
</center>


## Random draws and distributions

```{r}
normal_distr <- rnorm(1000)
hist(normal_distr)
```




## Illustration of variability

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# draw a random sample from a normal distribution with a large standard deviation
largevar <- rnorm(10000, mean = 5000, sd = 5)
# draw a random sample from a normal distribution with a small standard deviation
littlevar <- rnorm(10000, mean = 5000, sd = 1)
```


## Illustration of variability

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# visualize the distributions of both samples with a density plot
plot(density(littlevar), col = "blue", 
     xlim=c(min(largevar), max(largevar)), main="Income Distribution")
lines(density(largevar), col = "red")

```
<!-- **Note:** the red curve illustrates the distribution of the sample with a large standard deviation (a lot of variability) whereas the blue curve illustrates the one with a rather small standard deviation. -->


## Skewness and kurtosis

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# install the R-package called "moments" with the following command (if not installed yet):
# install.packages("moments")

# load the package
library(moments)

```


## Skewness

- Skewness refers to how symetric the frequency distribution of a variable is. 
- For example, a distribution can be *'positively skewed'* meaning it has a *long tail on the right* and a lot of 'mass' (observations) on the left. 

## Skewness: R example

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# draw a random sample of simulated data from a normal distribution
# the sample is of size 1000 (hence, n = 1000)
sample <- rnorm(n = 1000)

# plot a histogram and a density plot of that sample
# note that the distribution is neither strongly positively nor negatively skewed
# (this is to be expected, as we have drawn a sample from a normal distribution!)
hist(sample)


```


## Skewness: R example

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# now compute the skewness
skewness(sample)

```

## Skewness: R example

```{r, echo=TRUE}
# now we intentionally change our sample to be strongly positively skewed
# we do that by adding some outliers (observations with very high values) to the sample 
sample <- c(sample, (rnorm(200) + 2), (rnorm(200) + 3))

# have a look at the distribution and re-calculate the skewness
hist(sample)
skewness(sample)


```


## Skewness: R example

```{r, echo=TRUE}

# have a look at the distribution and re-calculate the skewness
hist(sample)
skewness(sample)


```



## Kurtosis

- Kurtosis refers to how much 'mass' a distribution has in its 'tails'. 
- Tells us something about whether a distribution tends to have a lot of outliers. 



## Kurtosis: R example
```{r}
# draw a random sample of simulated data from a normal distribution
# the sample is of size 1000 (hence, n = 1000)
sample <- rnorm(n = 1000)

# plot the density & compute the kurtosis
hist(sample)

```


## Kurtosis: R example
```{r}

# compute the kurtosis
kurtosis(sample)

```


## Kurtosis: R example
```{r}

# now lets remove observations from the extremes in this distribution
# we thus intentionally alter the distribution to have less mass in its tails
sample <- sample[ sample > -0.6 & sample < 0.6]

```



## Kurtosis: R example
```{r}


# plot the distribution again and see how the tails have changed
hist(sample)

# re-calculate the kurtosis
kurtosis(sample)
# as expected, the kurtosis has now a lower value

```


## Compute the skewness in R


**Skewness**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# own implementation
sum((sample-mean(sample))^3) / ((length(sample)-1) * sd(sample)^3)

# implementation in moments package
skewness(sample)
```

## Compute the kurtosis in R

**Kurtosis**
```{r, echo=TRUE}
# own implementation
sum((sample-mean(sample))^4) / ((length(sample)-1) * sd(sample)^4)

# implementation in moments package
kurtosis(sample)
```








## The Law of Large Numbers (LLN)

- Important statistical property.
- Essentially describes how the behavior of *sample averages* is related to *sample size*.
- States that the *sample mean* can come arbitrarily close to the *population mean* by increasing the sample size $N$.

## The Law of Large Numbers (LLN): playing dice

- Roll a fair die, record result: either  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- Probability of each possible outcome is $1/6$.


## The Law of Large Numbers (LLN): playing dice

- Roll a fair die, record result: either  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- Probability of each possible outcome is $1/6$.
- Expected value (average in the long run): $(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)/6 = 3.5$



## The Law of Large Numbers (LLN): playing dice

- Roll a fair die, record result: either  1, 2, 3, 4, 5, or 6.
- Probability of each possible outcome is $1/6$.
- Expected value (average in the long run): $(1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6)/6 = 3.5$
- Proof? 
  - Mathematically.
  - Or: Experiment/Simulation (with R).


## LLN in R

```{r dice10, echo=TRUE}
# first we define the potential values a die can take
dvalues <- 1:6 # the : operater generates a regular sequence of numbers (from:to)
dvalues
# define the size of the sample n (how often do we roll the die...)
# for a start, we only roll the die ten times
n <- 10
# draw the random sample: 'roll the die n times and record each result'
results <- sample( x = dvalues, size = n, replace = TRUE)
# compute the mean
mean(results)
```

## LLN in R

```{r dice100, echo=TRUE}
n <- 100
# draw the random sample: 'roll the die n times and record each result'
results <- sample( x = dvalues, size = n, replace = TRUE)
# compute the mean
mean(results)
```

## LLN in R

```{r lln, echo=TRUE}
# essentially, what we are doing here is repeating the experiment above many times,
# each time increasing n
# define the set of sample sizes
ns <- seq(from = 10, to = 10000, by = 10)
# initiate an empty list to record the results
means <- list()
length(means) <- length(ns)
# iterate through each sample size: 'repeat the die experiment for each sample size'
for (i in 1:length(ns)) {
     
     means[[i]] <- mean(sample( x = dvalues, size = ns[i], replace = TRUE))
}


```



## LLN in R

```{r lln2, echo=TRUE}
# visualize the result: plot sample means against sample size
plot(ns, unlist(means),
     ylab = "Sample Mean",
     xlab = "Sample Size",
     pch = 16,
     cex = .6)
abline(h = 3.5, col = "red")
```



<!-- ## The Central Limit Theorem -->

<!-- The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) is an almost miraculous statistical property enabling us to test the statistical significance of a statistic such as the mean. In essence, the CLT states that as long as we have a large enough sample, the t-statistic (applied, e.g., to test whether the mean is equal to a particular value) is approximately standard normal distributed. This holds independently of how the underlying data is distributed. -->

<!-- Consider the dice play example above. We might want to statistically test whether we are indeed playing with a fair die (which would imply an expected mean value of 3.5!). In order to test that we would roll the die 100 times and record each resulting value. We would then compute the sample mean and standard deviation in order to assess how likely it was to observe the mean we observe if the population mean actually is 3.5 (thus our H0 would be pop_mean = 3.5, or in plain English 'the die is fair'). However, the distribution of the resulting die values are not standard normal distributed. So how can we interpret the sample standard deviation and the sample mean in the context of our hypothesis? -->

<!-- The simplest way to interpret these measures is by means of a *t-statistic*. A t-statistic for the sample mean under our working hypothesis that pop_mean = 3.5 is constructed as `t(3.5) = (sample_mean - 3.5) / (sample_sd/sqrt(n))`. Let's illustrate this in R: -->

<!-- ```{r t-test} -->

<!-- # First we roll the die like above -->
<!-- n <- 100 -->
<!-- # draw the random sample: 'roll the die n times and record each result' -->
<!-- results <- sample( x = dvalues, size = n, replace = TRUE) -->
<!-- # compute the mean -->
<!-- sample_mean <- mean(results) -->
<!-- # compute the sample sd -->
<!-- sample_sd <- sd(results) -->
<!-- # estimated standard error of the mean -->
<!-- mean_se <- sample_sd/sqrt(n) -->

<!-- # compute the t-statistic: -->
<!-- t <- (sample_mean - 3.5) / mean_se -->
<!-- t -->

<!-- ``` -->

<!-- At this point you might wonder what the use of t is if the underlying data is not drawn from a normal distribution. In other words: what is the use of t if we cannot interpret it as a value that tells us how likely it is to observe this sample mean, given our null hypothesis? Well, actually we can. And here is where the magic of the CLT comes in: It turns out that there is a mathematical proof (i.e. the CLT) which states that the t-statistic itself can arbitrarily well be approximated by the standard normal distribution. This is true independent of the distribution of the underlying data in our sample! That is, if we have a large enough sample, we can simply compute the t-statistic and look up how likely it is to observe a value at least as large as t, given the null hypothesis is true (-> the p-value): -->

<!-- ```{r p-value} -->
<!-- # calculate the p-value associated with the t-value calculated above -->
<!-- 2*pnorm(-abs(t)) -->
<!-- ``` -->
<!-- In that case we could not reject the null hypothesis of a fair die. However, as pointed out above, the t-statistic is only assymptotically (meaning with very large samples) normally distributed. We might not want to trust this hypothesis test too much because we were using a sample of only 100 observations. -->

<!-- Let's turn back to R in order to illustrate the CLT at work. Similar to the illustration of the LLN above, we will repeatedly compute the t-statistic of our dice play experiment and for each trial increase the number of observations.  -->

<!-- ```{r clt} -->
<!-- # define the set of sample sizes -->
<!-- ns <- c(10, 40, 100) -->
<!-- # initiate an empty list to record the results -->
<!-- ts <- list() -->
<!-- length(ts) <- length(ns) -->
<!-- # iterate through each sample size: 'repeat the die experiment for each sample size' -->
<!-- for (i in 1:length(ns)) { -->

<!--      samples.i <- sapply(1:500000, function(j) sample( x = dvalues, size = ns[i], replace = TRUE)) -->
<!--      ts[[i]] <- apply(samples.i, function(x) (mean(x) - 3.5) / sd(x), MARGIN = 2) -->
<!-- } -->

<!-- # visualize the result: plot the density for each sample size -->

<!-- # plot the density for each set of t values -->
<!-- hist(ts[[1]], main = "Sample size: 10", xlab = "T-value") -->
<!-- hist(ts[[2]], main = "Sample size: 40", xlab = "T-value") -->
<!-- hist(ts[[3]], main = "Sample size: 100", xlab = "T-value") -->

<!-- # finally have a look at the actual standard normol distribution as a reference point -->
<!-- plot(function(t)dnorm(t), -4, 4, main = "Normal density") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note how the histogram is getting closer to a normal distribution with increasing sample size.  -->
